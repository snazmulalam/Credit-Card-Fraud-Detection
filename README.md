# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


Types of credit card fraud
 Credit card fraud falls into two basic categories: 

1. Card present fraud
2. Card-not-present fraud

### Card present fraud:
 Card present fraud is when the criminal uses a physical card, which is either stolen or duplicated, to make fraudulent purchases. Card present fraud can be the result of the theft of a card through robbery, pickpocketing, or mail theft. Criminals may also leverage card skimmers installed at frequently used payment points to collect and store the card details when swiped; this data can then be used to produce a duplicate payment card, or clone.

### Card-not-present fraud:
 Card-not-present fraud is when the criminal uses the details associated with the card, such as the card number, accountholder name, and CVV code, without having the card in their possession. In some cases, card-not-present crime is accompanied by account takeover techniques. This is when fraudsters contact a credit card issuer and purport to be a legitimate card holder to change information associated with the account, such as a phone number or address. This will allow them to verify purchases and authenticate activity, thereby evading many fraud detection tools.

### Advances in card security:
 Since 2015, credit card fraud has shifted dramatically toward card-not-present crime. This is largely because of EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) chip technology introduced by major credit card companies around the world.  Sometimes referred to as chip and PIN, EMV equips credit and debit cards with a microchip that can be inserted into a card reader or scanned via contactless payment method to process the transaction. This method is far more secure in that criminals can no longer use card skimmers to capture data from the magnetic strip of the card and produce a clone.




At the same time, massive data breaches at various credit institutions, retailers and other businesses have created a black market for compromised credit card data and sensitive information. Cybercriminals that have stolen this information often post it on the dark web, making it available for purchase by other individuals. The availability of compromised card information, coupled with a rise in online shopping, has dramatically increased card-not-present credit card fraud. At present, there is no technological solution similar to an EMV microchip that can significantly reduce card-not-present fraud. Instead, the burden is on both credit card issuers and merchants to employ stronger digital security measures to identify and block fraudulent transactions in real-time.

### What is credit card fraud detection?
 Credit card fraud detection is the collective term for the policies, tools, methodologies, and practices that credit card companies and financial institutions take to combat identity fraud and stop fraudulent transactions. In recent years, as the amount of data has exploded and the number of payment card transactions has skyrocketed, fraud detection has become largely digitized and automated. Most modern solutions leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to manage data analysis, predictive modeling, decision-making, fraud alerts and remediation activity that occur when individual instances of credit card fraud are detected.  




‍#### Anomaly detection
 Anomaly detection is the process of analyzing massive amounts of data points from both internal and external sources to produce a framework of “normal” activity for each individual user and establish regular patterns in their activity. Data used to create the user profile includes:

1. Purchase history and other historical data
2. Location
3. Device ID
4. IP address
5. Payment amount
6. Transaction information
 

When a transaction falls outside the scope of normal activity, the anomaly detection tool will then alert the card issuer and, in some cases, the user. Depending on the transaction details and risk score assigned to the action, these fraud detection systems may flag the purchase for review or put a hold on the transaction until the user verifies their activity.
